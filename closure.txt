Closures
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)



Use Cases of Closures

Data Encapsulation

Closure provides a means to encapsulate data within functions, allowing for controlled access to that data while keeping it hidden from the outside scope.

- Functional Programming
Closures play a significant role in functional programming by enabling the creation of higher-order functions, which are functions that either take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as a result.

- Event Handling
Closures are powerful tools for managing event handling in JavaScript. They allow you to attach functions to events while maintaining access to the surrounding scope, which is particularly useful for data encapsulation and avoiding global variables.
